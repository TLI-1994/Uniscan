# Uniscan

**Uniscan** is a **lightweight, read-only command-line interface (CLI) tool** designed to **audit Unity projects** for potentially hazardous code and native binaries. It's a quick and simple way to get a security overview of your project without needing a complex setup. The tool scans C# scripts for risky patterns and provides a clear, color-coded summary directly in your terminal.

### Key Features
* **Static Code Analysis:** Scans C# scripts for common security vulnerabilities and anti-patterns.
* **Binary Detection:** Identifies native binary files (e.g., `.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) which can sometimes pose a risk.
* **Clear, Color-Coded Output:** Provides an easy-to-read summary of findings, highlighting issues with different colors.
* **Minimalist Design:** It's read-only, has minimal dependencies, and won't modify your project.
